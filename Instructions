@ HOW TO SETUP THE DISCORD BOT?

1 - invite the bot to the server
2 - run !setup in any chat ( make sure the bot has perms to create roles ) 
3 - once you ran !setup, the bot should've created a role called "whitelist"
4 - give the role "whitelist" to anyone you want to whitelist to the bots commands.


@ Q/A


Q - why do i have to whitelist people to use the bot commands?
A - so that the chats arent being spammed by random people, this bot is meant to be whitelist only.

Q - why arent the commands working for me?
A - you either arent whitelisted ( need whitelist role ), bot is updating, or bot is rate limited.

Q - whats the support server?
A - https://discord.com/invite/brooklyn

Q - how can i suggest commands to be added to the bot?
A - join https://discord.com/invite/brooklyn and then dm the owner ( <@700486551221698681> )

A - run !cmds in chat.
